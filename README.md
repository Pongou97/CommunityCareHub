Assignment: Project Description  



CommunityCareHub is a platform designed to connect people in the same community so they can offer and receive help. It allows users to post services, request help, and collaborate on local projects. The platform is built using cloud computing and distributed systems to make it reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant. By using modern technologies like Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and Redis, CommunityCareHub ensures that users can communicate in real time, make bookings safely, and always access the system even if one server fails. The main goal is to make communities stronger and more connected.

## Project Description
CommunityCareHub solves the problem of disconnected communities. Many people live near each other but rarely interact. This platform allows them to share skills, exchange resources, and help one another. Users can create posts to offer services like tutoring or repairs, and others can respond, chat, and book the services. Cloud computing allows the system to scale automatically if many users are online, while distributed systems ensure fault tolerance. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, the database uses PostgreSQL, and Redis manages real-time updates. React provides a clean interface for users. Security is ensured with JWT authentication and encrypted passwords. Overall, CommunityCareHub combines technology and social impact, showing how engineering can create real human connections.
